 - 👻 You can call me Irina
 - ⌨️ Beginner web-developer
 - 📓 Right now I’m learning at the course "Web-developer" from [Y.Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) with mentoring and supporting from great developers team. 
 - 🔧 Currently I’m working on my last project ["Mesto"](https://evamoer.github.io/mesto/). Next step is to re-make it, using ReactJS. By the way, I do some small things apart from curriculum program, for ex.: [tic-tac-toe](https://evamoer.github.io/tic-tac-toe/index.html), [rock-paper-scissors](https://evamoer.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/index.html), [digital clock](https://evamoer.github.io/digital-clock/index.html). 
 - 💭 Eva is not my name as some people may think, "evamoer" is just an anagram of my surname (Ermoeva)
 - 🤍 IT-community is new for me, so I’m shy here but always open to make friends and create new acquaintances.
 - 📩 You can email me: **evamoer@gmail.com** or text me via telegram: **@evamoer**
