### Hello, worldðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Currently Iâ€™m working on my last project ["Mesto"](https://evamoer.github.io/mesto/). Next step is to implement ReactJS (now it's made with vanilla JS only). 
- ðŸŒ± Rignt now Iâ€™m learning at the course "Web-developer" from [Y.Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) with mentoring and supporting of great developers team. 
- ðŸ‘¯ IT-community is new for me, so Iâ€™m shy here but always open to make friends and create new acquaintances.
- ðŸ“« You can email me: **evamoer@gmail.com** or text me via telegram: **@evamoer**
- âš¡ Fun fact: Eva is not my name as some people could think, **evamoer** is just an anagram of my surname (Irina Ermoeva) ðŸ˜„
